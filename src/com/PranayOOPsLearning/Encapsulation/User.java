/*
Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data(Variables) and the code acting on the
data(methods) together as a single unit

Oracle Book definition : Encapsulation describes the ability of an object to hide its data and
methods from the rest of the world

Example for encapsulation is Object. An Object is  reference of class which has all the data
and methods of a class are wrapped in it(capsuled in it (or) closed in it).

Encapsulation can be achieved by having private access modifiers to variables and methods with
in the  class, so that the data and methods are not public and wrapped and secured. If another
class needs to use those methods and data, they can achieve it by using getters and setters
using an object reference
